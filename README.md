# The bmodel package
ising model based boolean update inspired from https://github.com/ComplexityBiosystems/bmodel

Run the dependency installer script when running the files for the first time. 

To simulate the networks, copy script.jl to the folder where the topo files are, edit the first line to include the path to the bmodel.jl file and run it.

The package is under development, so expect some errors. A working version of the package can be found [here](https://github.com/askhari139/Boolean.jl)
